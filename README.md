# Employee-Attrition-Prediction

Employee attrition, or turnover, is a critical challenge for organizations as it impacts productivity, morale, and recruitment costs. This project aims to predict which employees are at risk of leaving using advanced machine learning techniques, enabling HR departments to take proactive measures for talent retention.

üîç Project Overview
The project leverages historical HR data containing employee demographics, job-related details, and performance metrics. By analyzing patterns in this data, the system predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the organization. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that can support strategic HR planning.

üõ† Workflow & Methodology
Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

Addressed missing values and ensured data consistency.

Encoded categorical variables and standardized numerical features for model readiness.

Feature Engineering

Identified and selected key variables such as job satisfaction, years at company, salary hikes, and work-life balance.

Enhanced interpretability by analyzing feature importance.

Model Development

Implemented and compared multiple machine learning algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Model Evaluation

Used performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the best-performing model.

Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy, while Decision Tree excelled in cross-validation scenarios.

üìà Results & Impact
The final model delivers high prediction accuracy, enabling HR teams to focus retention efforts on high-risk employees. Early identification of attrition risks helps reduce turnover costs, maintain team stability, and improve employee satisfaction.
